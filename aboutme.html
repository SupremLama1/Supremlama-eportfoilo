<p >Hello my name is Suprem Lama. I am 19 years old. I am from nepal. My major is Anumation at BMCC.I came to US 5 years ago with my mom to study. My dad came in US when about 10 years ago. he used to travel a lot so yea he been going from country to country to find job. He felt like this would be the right future for every one so i think he stayed in America. I am the type of person who doesnot like to follow what people say is the best for me. I love to play games. I am also a professional gamer in a Esports team. I really hate taking pictures and going outside. I am creative. And if i like to do something i will out my effort and time in it to make it look better. I am very good at taking risk. I used to love drawing but i guess when time passes you dont become your self anymore. Yoou feel like the things you used to do when you were small isnt fun anymore. You will have more responsibilities when you get more mature. Sometimes i just go deep and think ablut some stuuf people dont usually think like what if there was no such thing as money, what if everyone would just get along and so that no body would die and other. You only have one life to live so i feel like i have to enjoy it, All people care about nowdays is money. they feel like money is happiness when its not. You wont be able to take money with you when you die so i feel like you need to enjoy your life and also do what you are suppose to do at the same time. </p>
